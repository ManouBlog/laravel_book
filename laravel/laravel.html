        What Is the MVC Pattern?
    How do you successfully implement user interfaces with Laravel and follow the
   separation of concerns principle? The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture is the
    answer. And Laravel helps you do this quite easily (Figure 1-3).
   The workflow is simple: the user action reaches the controller from the view. The
   controller notifies the model. Accordingly, the model updates the controller. After that,
    the controller again updates the user.
    </p>
    <p>
        That is why it is commonly used and a popular choice. The separation of concerns
principle usually separates the application logic from the presentation layers in Laravel.
Quite naturally, your application will become more flexible, modular, and reusable.
Let’s imagine a social networking application where you want to view a user’s page.
You may click a link that looks like this:
https://example.com/home/index/username
Here you can imagine that home is the controller, index is the method, and in the
username section you can even pass an ID. This is pretty simple, and it takes you to the
user’s page. How you can make your app work through an MVC model like this?
As you might guess, you will get the user’s data from a database. The model defines
what data your application should contain. So, it is model’s job to interact with the
database. Now, a user’s database will be constantly evolving; changes will take place, and
the user will make updates. If the state of this data changes, the model will usually notify
the view. If different logic is needed to control the view, the model notifies the controller.
    </p>
    <p>
        Keeping the social media app in mind, the model would specify what data a list item
should contain, such as first name, last name, location, and so on.
The role of the controller is critical. It contains the programming logic that updates
the model and sometimes the view in response to input from the users of the app. In
other social media apps, almost the same thing happens. The app could have input
forms to allow you to post or edit or delete the data. The actions require the model to be
updated, so the input is sent to the controller, which then acts upon the model, and the
model then sends the updated data to the view. Now, this view can be manipulated in a
different manner; you can use your layout template engine. In some cases, the controller
can handle these tasks independently without needing to update the model.
Compared to the functions of the model and the controller, the workflow of the view
consists of simple tasks. It will define only how the list is presented to another user. It will
also receive the data from the model to display.
Actually, you have seen this pattern before. The data model uses some kind of
database, probably MySQL in the LAMP technology. In such cases, your controller’s
code is written in PHP, and in your view part, you have used a combination of HTML
and CSS.
    </p>
    <h1>
        How the MCV pattern works?
    </h1>
    <p>
Imagine a portal, where your user interacts with the user interface in some way, such as
by clicking a link or submitting a form. Now, the controller takes charge and handles the
user input event from the user interface. Consequently, the controller notifies the model
of the user action. Usually, the state of model changes. Suppose the controller updates
the status of the user. It interacts with the model, and the model has no direct knowledge
of the view. The model passes data objects to the controller, and then your controller
generates the content with that dynamic data.
Because of its simple iterations and the principle of separation of concerns, the MVC
pattern is often found in web application.
Now, the MVC pattern can be interpreted in different ways: A section of people
thinks that the actual processing part is handled by the model, and the controller
handles only the input data. In such interpretations, the input-processing-output flow
is represented by Controller-Model-View; here the controller interprets the mouse and
keyboard inputs from the user.
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, a controller is responsible for mapping end-user actions to application
responses, whereas a model’s actions include activating business processes or changing
the state of the model. The user’s interactions and model’s response decide how a
controller will respond by selecting an appropriate view.
To summarize, an MVC pattern must have a minimum of three components, each
of which performs its own responsibilities. Now many MVC frameworks add extra
functionalities such as a data access object (DAO) to communicate with the relational
database.
In normal circumstances, the data flow between each of these components carries
out its designated tasks; however, it is up to you to decide how this data flow is to be
implemented. With the MVC framework, you will learn that the data is pushed by
the controller into the view. At the same time, the controller keeps manipulating the
data in the model. Now the question is, who is doing the real processing? The model
or controller? Does the controller play an intermediary role, and behind the scenes,
the model actually pulls the strings? Or, is the controller the actual processing unit
controlling the database manipulations and representation simultaneously?
It does not matter as long as the data flows and the pattern works. In the Laravel
applications in this book, you will implement MVC in a way so that the controller will do
processing jobs, controlling the model and the view simultaneously.
When using the MVC framework, you must keep a separate DAO, and the model
will handle the DAO as appropriate. Therefore, all SQL statements can be generated and
executed in only one place. Data validation and manipulation can be applied in one
place: the model. The controller will handle the request/response lifecycle, taking the
input from the user interface and updating model accordingly. When the controller gets
the green signal from the model, it sends the response to the view. The view is aware of
only one thing: the display.

    <h1>Setting Up Your Environment</h1>
    <p>
        This chapter will help you install Composer, both locally and globally, and introduce you
to Valet, Homestead, VirtualBox, Vagrant, and Forge. You will also learn how to create a
new project in Laravel 5.8 using your Homestead development environment.
    </p>
    <p>
        Composer
Composer is a dependency management tool in PHP. For any PHP project, you need
to use a library of code. Composer easily manages this task on your behalf, helping you
to declare those libraries and packages. You can also install or update any code in your
library through Composer. Please visit https://getcomposer.org for more details.
Without the help of the Composer dependency manager, you cannot install Laravel.
Moreover, as you dig deeper into Laravel, you will need even more packages and libraries
to build your application.
You can install Composer in two ways.
• Locally: You can download and install Composer each time for every
project rather than running Composer globally on your system.
Because you install Composer locally each time, you will have no
trace of the Composer package manager on your host machine.
• Globally: The global option is always preferable because once
Composer is installed in your system’s bin folder, you can call it anytime
for any project. Whether you use Windows, Debian-based Linux like
Ubuntu, or macOS, the global option always rules over the local one.
I’ll show how to install Composer globally in the next section and then cover the
local option.
    </p>
    <p>
        Installing Composer Globally
For any Debian-based Linux distribution like Ubuntu or macOS, you can download
Laravel using Composer in any folder anywhere and start working with it. If you use
Windows, I suggest you download helper software like XAMPP that comes with the
LAMP technology.
Installing Composer globally on your system requires a few steps, as shown here, in
your terminal:
 <pre>
    //how to install Composer globally
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install curl php-cli php-mbstring git unzip
    $ curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer -o composer-setup.php
 </pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        Here you need to run a short PHP script to match the secret key. Issue this command
on your terminal:
    </p>
    <pre>
        php -r "if (hash_file('SHA384', 'composer-setup.php') ===
'669656bab3166a7aff8a7506b8cb2d1c292f042046c5a994c43155c0be6190fa0355160742
ab2e1c88d40d5be660b410') { echo 'Installer verified'; } else { echo
'Installer corrupt'; unlink('composer-setup.php'); } echo PHP_EOL;"
    </pre>
    <p>
        You will get output like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
        Installer verified
    </pre>
    <p>
        After that, you need to move Composer to your /usr/local/bin folder. Run this
command:
    </p>
    <pre>
        $ sudo php composer-setup.php --install-dir=/usr/local/bin
--filename=composer
    </pre>
    <p>
        You will get output like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
        All settings correct for using Composer
Downloading 1.1.1...
Composer successfully installed to: /usr/local/bin/composer
Use it: php /usr/local/bin/composer
    </pre>
    <h1>Installing Laravel Globally</h1>
    <p>
        Next, you need to be using a LAMP server properly. This means you already have an
operating system based on Linux, and you have the Apache web server, the MySQL
database, and at least PHP 7.0. If this architecture is all set up, you can go ahead and
download Laravel with a simple command like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
        //code 2.1
//installing Laravel with global composer
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel
YourFirstLaravelProject
    </pre>
    <p>
        You can even be choosy with a particular Laravel version such as this:
    </p>
    <pre>
        //code 2.2
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel blog "5.7.*"
    </pre>
    <p>
        Once you have Composer installed on your Windows system, you can use the same
command to install Laravel in the C:\xampp\htdocs\Dashboard\YourPreferredFolder
directory. You can use a terminal almost the same way as in Linux or macOS. There are
small differences between operating systems; for example, on Linux or macOS, you use
ls -la for a long listing, but in Windows, you use dir. These commands will tell you
what is inside the Laravel folder.
On all operating systems, the next command to run Laravel is as follows:
    </p>
    <pre>
        //code 2.3
//running Laravel
$ php artisan serve
    </pre>
    <p>
        You can now go to http://localhost:8000 to see what’s there.
        The artisan command is the most powerful tool Laravel comes with. With the help
of the artisan command, you can create all the necessary components you need for
your application.
    </p>
    <p>
        The artisan command creates the following:
• Controller
• Models
• Migrations
Chapter 2 Setting Up Your Environment
• Seeds
• Tests
And there are many other components the artisan command creates. artisan also
helps you work with your database using tools like Tinker. I will cover those features in
later chapters.
You already saw how artisan helps you start the web server
    </p>
    <pre>
        //code 2.4
//starting local web server in laravel
$ php artisan serve
    </pre>
    <p>
        You can also take the application into maintenance mode.
    </p>
    <pre>
        //code 2.5
//Taking application to the maintenance mode
$ php artisan down
    </pre>
    <p>
        After your maintenance work has been finished, you can issue the up command in
the same way and again start the web server.
Clearing the cache is also simple.
    </p>
    <pre>
        //code 2.6
//Clearing cache
$ php artisan cache:clear
    </pre>
    <p>
        These are a few examples of how Laravel makes a developer’s life easier. As you
progress in the book, you will see artisan used frequently.

    <h1>
        How to Create a New Laravel Project
    </h1>
    <P>
        You’ll name your application larastartofinish. This is an abbreviation of the full
project name “Laravel Start to Finish.” The code directory will be mapped to the
Homestead development environment. So, from now on, you will install your Laravel
applications there <br>
Staying in the /home/ss/code directory, you can install your Laravel application by
issuing this command:
    </P>
    <pre>
        //code 2.35
$ composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel larastartofinish
    </pre>
    <p>
        This will install a fresh Laravel application in your /home/ss/code directory. Next,
issue the following command for macOS/Linux in a terminal:
    </p>
    <pre>
        //code 2.36
$ sudo rm -rf vendor/ composer.lock
    </pre>
    <p>
        Basically, you have removed the Laravel dependencies that ship with
Laravel, because you need to freshly install the new dependencies for your new
larastartofinish application. So, issue this command:
    </p>
    <pre>
        //code 2.37
$ composer install
    </pre>
    <p>
        This will again install the necessary vendor folder and composer.lock file. You have
successfully installed a new Laravel application in the /home/ss/code directory. Now
you can start your Homestead development environment and start working on this
application.
Staying in the Homestead folder, issue the following command:
    </p>
    <pre>
        vagrant up --provision
    </pre>
    <p>
        Next, issue the following command to start your Homestead development
environment:
    </p>
    <pre>
        vagrant ssh
    </pre>
    <p>
        Then, change your directory like this so that it points to the /home/ss/code/
larastartofinish directory:
    </p>
    <pre>
        //code 2.38
vagrant@homestead:~$ cd code/larastartofinish/
    </pre>
    <p>
        Next, you do not need to start your local server here. The advantage of Homestead
is that now you can type http://my.local in your browser and view your new Laravel
application. Next, you can create your first controller here by issuing this command:
    </p>
    <pre>
        vagrant@homestead:~/code/larastartofinish$ php artisan make:controller
ArticleController --resource –model=Article
Controller created successfully.
    </pre>
    <p>
        vagrant@homestead:~/code/larastartofinish$ php artisan make:controller
ArticleController --resource –model=Article
Controller created successfully.
    </p>
